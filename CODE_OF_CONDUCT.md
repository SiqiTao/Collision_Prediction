Participation in this project shall be a harassment-free experience for all individuals, regardless of their race, colour, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, socioeconomic status, disabilities, education level, age, mental health, physical appearance, and level of experience.

## Our Standards

The behaviour of contributors and maintainers of the project should foster a positive environment. Aspects of behaviour that foster a positive environment include:

* Communicating with welcoming and inclusive language
* Respecting differing viewpoints and experiences
* Being open to new ideas and constructive criticism
* Focusing on the needs of the community
* Showing empathy to each other’s situation
* Acknowledging each other’s time and hard work

Examples of unacceptable behavior by community members include but are not limited to:

* Sexual harassment, including unwanted sexual advances and comments
* Violence of any nature
* Hurtful language that insults/offends others or otherwise makes others uncomfortable
* Releasing others personal information without consent
* Any conduct that would not be acceptable in a professional work environment

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting a member of the project team. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
